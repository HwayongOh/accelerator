# Accelerator
Accelerator is a software component designed to improve the performance of a blockchain network, e.g. Hyperledger Fabric, in terms of transaction throughput. Accelerator enables the blockchain network to deal with a huge number of transaction requests from applications. 

This project, named Innovation Sandbox, provides tools and methods to download, test, and reproduce the improved performance results using Accelerator on Hyperledger Fabric. The intent is to enable blockchain developers to run it to see how much performance benefits they can expect in reproducible ways.

## Hyperledger Caliper
Caliper is a blockchain performance benchmark framework which is one of the Hyperledger projects. This project, Innovation Sandbox, also uses Caliper to measure the improved performance by Accelerator. The project was generated by forking Caliper project, and a new adaptor module and smart contracts were added to utilize Accelerator.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- NodeJS 8.X
- node-gyp
- Docker
- Docker-compose

### Installing
Run 'npm install' and 'npm run fabric-v1.2-deps' in innovation-sandbox directory

### Running the tests
The current version supports two benchmark scenarios, simple and smallbank which are provided by Caliper. Move to the benchmark scenario directory (e.g. benchmark/simple) and run ‘node main.js’ for the test. The command automatically downloads a docker image of Accelerator, configure Fabric network, and run benchmark tests.
For more test options, please refer to Caliper documents.
